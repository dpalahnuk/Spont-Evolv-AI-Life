Eco-Thermodynamically Plausible Spontaneously Self Replicating and Evolving AI Machines

The effect of raw material selection, raw material sources, on life cycle energy balance for AI Machines, and the thermodynamics estimate of the required energy to sustain such machines. Exposition on the estimated energy requirements as evolved over multiple generations, and at what point a sustainable self replicating AI Machine can hypothetically exist with resources autonomously gathered from its own environment.
